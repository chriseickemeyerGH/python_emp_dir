Employee Directory Python Application

This project is meant to be an interface for adding and updating a file containing employee directory data

To run:
-- In PyCharm or another IDE: Run file 'src/Main.py' (in PyCharm, mark 'src' as 'Sources Root' for file imports to work)
-- In Anaconda Navigator: Navigate to 'src' directory and enter 'python Main.py'

After successfully starting, follow the directions given by the application

Other classes used in 'src/Main.py' are also inside 'src' as their own file
and any file read or written to while running the application will sit inside this directory as well

To test, visit the 'tests' directory and run respective tests (35 total)
